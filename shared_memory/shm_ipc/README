Server and client communication using shared memory
Server :

	Write the data into the share memory

Client :
	Read the shared memory.
	Write the data into shared memory to kill the server.

Procedure to run the code :
----------------------------
Server should be started before any client. 
$./sever
$./client

To see the status of shared memory from terminal
	$ipcs -m
To destroy the allocated shared memory from terminal
	$ipcrm -M <key>
