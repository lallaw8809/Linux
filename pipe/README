####################### PIPE ##############

*) A pipe is a type of IPC, half duplex and can communicate between the related process.
*) Pipe is to send the output of one process (STDOUT) to an another process (STDIN) 
   for further processing. 

Example :
	$ cmd1 | cmd2 | cmd3
	$ps -ef | grep <process_name>

STDIN  (0) - Standard input (data fed into the program)
STDOUT (1) - Standard output (data printed by the program, defaults to the terminal)
STDERR (2) - Standard error (for error messages, also defaults to the terminal)

Program :
_________

one_pipe.c : Communication between the process [Parent and child :Half duplex]
	     Write it on the child
	     Read it on the Parent
	     Run the code  : <./one_pipe>  <msg>

two_pipe.c : Communication between the process [Full duplex]
	     Communication between two process using two pipes.
	      Run the code  : ./one_chile   'Hello Parent'  'Hello child'

Procedure to run the code
--------------------------
	$ make
		This will creaate a binaries under bin directory
