################# Signal #########

	Signal is an IPC.
	Signals are software interrupts sent to a program to indicate that an important event has occurred. The events can vary from user requests to illegal memory access errors. Some signals, such as the interrupt signal, indicate that a user has asked the program to do something that is not in the usual flow of control.
	A SIGINT signal that is generated when a user presses ctrl+c. This is the way to terminate programs from terminal.
